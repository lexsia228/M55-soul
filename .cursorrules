You are implementing M55 under strict SSOT constraints.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1) Background NoTouch:
   - NEVER modify html/body background, global gradients, or page-wide background visuals.
   - All visual styling must stay inside components/cards/surfaces.

2) No Notifications:
   - NEVER add bell icons, badges, unread markers, red dots, counters, notification UI, or wording implying notifications.

3) No Ranking / No Scores / No Percent:
   - NEVER render scores, %, gauges, rankings, "おすすめ/人気/最適/成功" style optimization language.
   - If a numeric UI is present, only "Days Recorded" is allowed (no %).

4) No Infinite Motion:
   - NEVER apply infinite/loop animations.
   - Reduce Motion must disable transitions/animations.

5) A-plan Routing:
   - Only Home / AI Chat / MyPage are navigable.
   - Tarot and DTR must be quiet-disabled (opacity 0.30 + pointer-events none).
   - No dead-end navigation, no error pages.

6) File Discipline:
   - Do not edit frozen SSOT artifacts.
   - Keep changes minimal and explain each change briefly.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
- Provide a short report: files changed + why + key diffs.
- If you add JS/CSS, ensure it does not introduce banned words: badge, unread, notification, notif, infinite, spinner.
